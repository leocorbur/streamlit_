# Streamlit LAS Data Visualization App 🚀

Hi Community! 🚀 Welcome to the repository for my Streamlit project, where I've made significant progress since our last update. The journey has been nothing short of fantastic!

## Project Overview 👑

I'm thrilled to introduce an application built with Streamlit, designed to empower users working with LAS format files. The application allows users to upload LAS files, perform various visualization and interaction operations, and gain valuable insights from the data.

## Key Features 🔍

### Visualization:
- Display the first 5 rows of data.
- Display the last 5 rows of data.
- Present data statistics.
- Explore data dimensions.
- Nullity matrix: visualize the distribution of non-null and null values in each column.

### Interaction:
- Select columns for BoxPlot visualization and log plotting.
- Remove null values or impute values in the selected columns.
- Imputation options: mean, median, specific value, or zero.
- Choose logarithmic columns.
- Select columns for the X-axis (excluding the depth column).
- Specify a mandatory column for the Y-axis (must be the depth column).
- Set plotting ranges for each column.

## Libraries Used 🛠️

## Acknowledgments 🙌

A special thanks to Henry for the knowledge acquired during their course. Without their training, this project wouldn't have been possible!

I'd also like to express gratitude to the Andy McDonald YouTube channel, which proved to be an invaluable source of help during the development of the graphics.
